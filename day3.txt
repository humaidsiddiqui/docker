DOCKER PULL:
lets pull docker mysql image from the hub
after pulling the image you need to to set -e (environment) and password to login into the mysql server
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql
after running this command the terminal screen will get blocked 
SO it's always suggested to run the images in detached mode (background)
to run the docker in background run with -d 
which will run the container in background 


the docker has its own lifecycle 

deleting a file in linux 
rm -v dockerfile(verbose which shows how its getting deleted)
what should an image should contains:application code,libraries, the OS information, frameworks, pakages and tools
to pull images you type FROM

FROM OPENJDK:17-jdk-alpine (NAME OF THE IMAGE)(TAG OF THE IMAGE)

you will get the environment of java from it
then you need to make the working directory where your source code will stored.

WORKDIR /app (making app folder in the container)

COPY src/Main.java /app/Main.java (copy all the sourcecode from host to the container)
(copy run from are all the syntax of docker files)

RUN javac Main.java
(this will compile the image)

CMD["java","Main"]
(This will run the image) 
and also execute the image as well  
ENTRYPOINT also serve the same purspose but cmd can be overwritten by docker run command but ENTRYPOINT Won't

every line in the docker image are layers to run a application (steps or instructions)
now after making the file we need build the image of it but this command (dockerfile->docker image->docker container)
docker build javaapp . (the dot refers to the context)
docker images (to check whther the image is build or not)
 whenever the host program makes changes. then you need to update the image as well
