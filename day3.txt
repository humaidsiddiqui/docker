DOCKER PULL:
lets pull docker mysql image from the hub
after pulling the image you need to to set -e (environment) and password to login into the mysql server
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql
after running this command the terminal screen will get blocked 
SO it's always suggested to run the images in detached mode (background)
